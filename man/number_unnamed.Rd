\usage{
number_unnamed(l)
}
\arguments{
\item{l}{\code{list}}
}
\description{
JavaScript starts at \code{0}, but R starts at \code{1}.
This means unnamed lists and vectors are indexed starting at
\code{0} in listviewer widgets.  This little helper function
tries to resolve the disconnect by assigning sequential numbers
starting at \code{1} to names for unnamed \code{lists} and \code{vectors}.
Please note though that using \code{number_unnamed} will potentially
cause difficulties serializing back and forth between JavaScript and R.
